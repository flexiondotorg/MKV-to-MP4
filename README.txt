Introduction

Creates a PlayStation 3 compatible MPEG-4 from a MKV, assuming video is H.264 
and audio is AC3 or DTS with as little re-encoding as possible. Xbox 360 
compatible MPEG-4 can also be generated by forcing audio encoding to use stereo.

AAC 5.1 audio will have the correct channel assignments when transcoding from 
AC3 5.1 and DTS 5.1. Detects profile 5.1 H.264 and patches it to 4.1 in under a 
second.

Any subtitles in the MKV are extracted and converted to 3GPP Timed Text and 
stored in a seperate file. The PS3 can't display these subtitles but some 
software players can. 

Splits the MKV, if it is greater than 4GB, to maintain PS3/Xbox 360 and FAT32 
compatibility in the resulting MPEG-4 files. 

This script work on Ubuntu Linux, should work on any other Linux/Unix flavour 
and possibly Mac OS X providing you have the required tools installed. 

Usage

  ./MKV-to-MP4.sh movie.mkv [--yes] [--stereo] [--faac] [--help]

You can also pass several optional parameters
  --yes    : Answer Yes to all prompts.
  --stereo : Force a stereo down mix.
  --faac   : Force the use of faac, even if NeroAacEnc is available.
  --help   : This help.

Install

MKV-to-MP4.sh requires a52dec 0.7.5 CVS and dcadec 0.0.5. a52dec can decode AC3
to 5.1 channel WAV files and dcadec can de decode DTS to 5.1 channel WAV files. 

This is how to install a52dec 0.7.5 CVS on Ubuntu or Debian.

 aptitude install build-essential cvs
 cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@liba52.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/liba52 co -P a52dec
 cd a52dec
 ./bootstrap
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
 make
 sudo make install

This is how to install dcadec 0.0.5 on Ubuntu or Debian.

 aptitude install build-essential
 wget -c http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/libdca/0.0.5/libdca-0.0.5.tar.bz2
 tar jxvf libdca-0.0.5.tar.bz2
 cd libdca-0.0.5/
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
 make
 cd src
 sudo make install 

If 'neroAacEnc' is installed then if MKV-to-MP4.sh will use it in preference to 
'faac' for encoding the AAC audio as it produces better quality output. 
neroAacEnc is optional, this is how to install it.

 wget http://ftp6.nero.com/tools/NeroDigitalAudio.zip
 unzip NeroDigitalAudio.zip
 chmod 755 linux/*
 sudo mv linux/* /usr/local/bin/

Requirements

 - a52dec, bash, cat, cut, dcadec, echo, faac, file, grep, mkfifo, mktemp, 
   mkvextract, mkvinfo, mkvmerge, mp4creator, neroAacEnc, python, rm, sed, stat, 
   MP4Box
   
Known Limitations

 - DTS is downmixed to stereo when using 'faac' because is does play nicely with
   'dcadec' wav6 output.
 - Option to answer "Yes" to all prompts is not implemented.
 - Could be faster with better use of FIFOs to reduce file I/O.
 - Muxing subtitles causes is not supported by 'mp4creator', waiting on MP4Box 
   fixes...
